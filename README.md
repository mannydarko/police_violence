# DataViz_Project1 - Proposal

## Police Shootings and Militarization

### Manny Darko, Juliana Kennedy, Philip Silberman

#### Research Outline and Questions

* Police shootings are on the rise in the United States over the last 20 years. We intend to profile the most common victims of police violence. Are there any notable trends among these victims? Why is there such a large spike of police violence in the last 5 years?

* Since 1990, the 1033 program allowed police to obtain unused Department of Defense equipment. What sorts of equipment are police receiving? Where is this type of equipment being allocated?

* Is there a relationship between the increase in police shootings and the possession of military equipment?

#### Tasks

* Analyze the data for any structural flaws and clean the data where necessary.

* Create summary statistics for each of the datasets.

* Visualize trends over time (shootings over time, equipment by area, equipment allocation over time).

* Summarize research and report findings.
